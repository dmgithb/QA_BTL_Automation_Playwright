# 🚨 Quick Fix: 404 Error Resolution

## 🎯 **Immediate Action Plan**

Your GitHub Pages is showing 404. Let's fix this step by step:

### **Step 1: Check Pages Configuration** (1 minute)
```
🔗 Go to: https://github.com/jibinjoyqa/btl-playwright-automation/settings/pages

✅ Check if you see:
   - Source: "GitHub Actions" (not "Deploy from a branch")
   - Status: "Your site is published at..."
   
❌ If you see "GitHub Pages is currently disabled":
   - Select "GitHub Actions" from the Source dropdown
   - Click "Save"
```

### **Step 2: Enable Workflow Permissions** (1 minute)
```
🔗 Go to: https://github.com/jibinjoyqa/btl-playwright-automation/settings/actions

✅ Set these options:
   - Workflow permissions: "Read and write permissions"
   - ✅ Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"
   - Click "Save"
```

### **Step 3: Force a New Deployment** (2 minutes)
```bash
# Run this in your terminal:
cd d:\BTLPlaywright
git commit --allow-empty -m "force GitHub Pages deployment"
git push origin main
```

### **Step 4: Monitor Deployment** (3-5 minutes)
```
🔗 Go to: https://github.com/jibinjoyqa/btl-playwright-automation/actions

👀 Watch for:
   1. "Playwright Tests" workflow starts
   2. "report" job completes successfully
   3. "pages build and deployment" workflow appears
   4. Both workflows show green checkmarks
```

### **Step 5: Test Access** (After workflows complete)
```
🔗 Try these URLs:
   1. https://jibinjoyqa.github.io/btl-playwright-automation/
   2. https://jibinjoyqa.github.io/btl-playwright-automation/index.html
   
⏰ Wait: 5-10 minutes for DNS propagation if still 404
```
