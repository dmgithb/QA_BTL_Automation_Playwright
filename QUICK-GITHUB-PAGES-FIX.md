# 🔧 **GitHub Pages Quick Fix**

## **Issue: GitHub Pages Not Enabled**

The workflow failed because GitHub Pages isn't properly configured. Here's how to fix it:

### **📋 Step-by-Step Fix:**

1. **Go to Repository Settings**: 
   - URL: https://github.com/jibinjoyqa/btl-playwright-automation/settings/pages
   - (This should be open in your browser)

2. **Configure Pages Source**:
   ```
   ✅ Source: Select "GitHub Actions" 
   ❌ NOT "Deploy from a branch"
   ```

3. **Click "Save"**

4. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for GitHub to enable Pages

### **🎯 Alternative: Use Main Workflow Instead**

Since the smoke test workflow has GitHub Pages issues, use the main workflow for now:

**Manual Trigger:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/jibinjoyqa/btl-playwright-automation/actions/workflows/playwright.yml
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select:
   - **test_type**: smoke
   - **browser**: chromium
4. Click "Run workflow"

### **🚀 Quick Test Run (Local)**

While fixing GitHub Pages, test smoke tests locally:

```bash
# Test smoke tests work locally
npm run test:smoke

# Or with specific grep
npx playwright test --grep "@smoke" --project=chromium
```

### **📊 Check Test Files Have @smoke Tags**

Let me verify your tests have proper smoke tags:

```bash
# Search for smoke-tagged tests
grep -r "@smoke" tests/
```

### **🔄 After GitHub Pages Fix**

Once Pages is enabled:
1. Push a small change to trigger workflows
2. Both smoke and main workflows will work
3. Reports will deploy to: https://jibinjoyqa.github.io/btl-playwright-automation/

### **⚡ Immediate Action Items:**

1. **Enable GitHub Pages** (link opened in browser)
2. **Run local smoke tests** to verify they work
3. **Use main workflow** as backup method
4. **Re-trigger after Pages is enabled**

The core issue is GitHub Pages configuration, not the smoke tests themselves!
