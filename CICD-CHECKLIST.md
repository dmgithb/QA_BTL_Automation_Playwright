## 📋 Next Steps (Do these in order)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
- [ ] Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
- [ ] Sign in to your account
- [ ] Click "+" → "New repository"

- [ ] **DON'T** check any initialization boxes
- [ ] Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Push Your Code to GitHub
Copy these commands and run them (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username):

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/btl-playwright-automation.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Configure Secrets in GitHub
1. [ ] Go to your repository → **Settings** tab
2. [ ] Click **"Secrets and variables"** → **"Actions"**
3. [ ] Add these 3 secrets (click "New repository secret" for each):

| Secret Name | Value |
|-------------|--------|
| `TEST_USER_USERNAME` | `jibin` |
| `TEST_USER_PASSWORD` | `Jerrin@123` |
| `BASE_URL` | `https://training.bt-ms.com/MAIN-STAGE/erp.php` |

### Step 4: Watch Your First CI/CD Run
- [ ] Go to **"Actions"** tab in your repository
- [ ] You'll see workflows running automatically
- [ ] Click on a workflow to watch the progress

## 🎉 What Will Happen

### Automatic Testing
✅ **On every code push**: All tests run automatically
✅ **Daily at 2 AM UTC**: Scheduled test runs
✅ **Pull requests**: Tests before merging

### Test Execution
- **Critical tests**: ~2-3 minutes
- **Smoke tests**: ~5-7 minutes  
- **Regression tests**: ~15-20 minutes
- **Security validation**: ~1-2 minutes

### Reports You'll Get
- 📊 HTML test reports
- 📸 Screenshots of failures
- 🎥 Video recordings
- 📋 Test summaries
- 🔐 Security validation results

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Your `.env` file stays local** - Never commit it to GitHub
2. **Secrets are encrypted** - Only your workflows can access them
3. **2,000 free minutes/month** - More than enough for your needs
4. **Private repository** - Your code and credentials stay secure

## 🎯 After Setup Complete

You'll have:
- ✅ Professional CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ Automated testing on code changes
- ✅ Secure credential management
- ✅ Beautiful test reports
- ✅ Team collaboration features
- ✅ Enterprise-grade quality assurance
